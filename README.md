# Shopping tracking list app

A simple app to view a list of purchased items, with store names, prices and estimated delivery dates.

## Project goals

My main goals in this project were to show my coding skills and execute the assignment as efficiently as possible.


## Project structure

The project has two routes:
    - Products by Item
    - Products by Store

### Products by item

In this route, there's a list of products purchased online, sorted by date of estimated delivery.
Every list item can be archived.
There are 2 tabs in this page, An item list tab and an Archived list tab.

### Products by Store

In this route, there's a list of all the stores in which products have been purchased.
Evey store in the list displays a number of items and a combined price of all items purchased in said store.
